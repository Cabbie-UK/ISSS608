Today, we covered a series of time/date related plots during lessons. Let's check out what we did!.

**A) Line and Cyclical Pattern Plot**

ðŸ‘‡*Use the slider to select a year-range, and select a country to display the overall tourist arrivals for the period on this Tableau dashboard.*

```
**B) Slope Graph**

This is essentially a variant of the line graph and was invented by Edward Tufte. Like the linegraph, it allows a change between points to be presented by a line. It shows 2 things:

-   The data points are arranged in descending, allowing us to identify which country has the highest rice yield for the year

-   The slope of the lines shows the rate the change during the period.

ðŸ‘‡*Use the year selector on the right to pick 2 years to see the graph in action*

**C) Calender Heatmap**
