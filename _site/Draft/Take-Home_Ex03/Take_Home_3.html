<p>We noticed that these rows contain list of entities in the <em>source</em> column, implying that there were records with many <em>source</em> entities to one single <em>target</em> entity. To flatten the records, we extracted and the converted such rows from the edge data frame to additional link records using the <code>separate_rows()</code> function to split each element into a separate row while duplicating the values in other columns.</p>

<p>Looking for businsses groups with anomalies</p>
<p>We were informed that companies with anomalous structures are far more likely to be involved in IUU (or other “fishy” business). Hence, we look into the following aspects of structural anormalies for among the seafood business groups:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Business Groups (or subgraphs) with high network diameter</li>
<li>Business Groups with with exceptional business revenue</li>
<li>Business Groups that operate across multiple countries with a number entities residing in a high risk country</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="business-groups-with-high-network-diameter">Business Groups with high network diameter</h2>
<p>To have a business structure wtihin a business group, we will need the sub-graph’s network diameter to have a minimum value of 2 and above. The higher the diameter, the more complex the structure of the business group is.</p>

<p><strong>Anomaly 1: Multiple Beneficial Owners surrounding a Seafood Company</strong></p>
<p>While it is common to have several owners per company, it was perplexing to see more than 10 beneficial owners (BOs) associated with a seafood entity. For Kerala Market SRL Wave on the right image below, it had 16 BOs (the red and purple icons), whereas Mar de Cristal AS from Group ID 34 only had 3 BOs.</p>
<table class="table">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 41%">
<col style="width: 58%">
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Common (Group ID 34)</th>
<th>Uncommon (Group ID 210)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><img src="images/paste-25AB1C7B.png" class="img-fluid"></td>
<td><img src="images/paste-1506EA48.png" class="img-fluid" width="334"></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Indeed, the histogram on the frequency count of BOs for companies below shows that based on the edge data set, the number of BOs, at 95% CI, for companies was between 1 and 10 and hence any entity with more than 10 BOs can be regarded as exceptional.</p>

<p><strong>Anomaly 2: Multiple and Same Set of Beneficial Owners Associated with 2 Companies</strong></p>
<p>As an extension of Anomaly 1 above, what was even more interesting was that we had multiple and the <u>same set</u> of BOs associated with 2 companies. In the diagram on the right below, we saw that The Salted Pearl - Oyj Marine Conservation and SeaScape Foods Ltd Freight (both from Group ID 210) sharing the same set of 16 BOs. The structure of Group ID 34 would be closer to what we see usually, where 2 companies may share some common owners, but not exactly the same set of owners.</p>

<p>It was interesting to note that Congo Rapids Ltd.&nbsp;Corporation had so many BOs when most companies had fewer than 10 of them. One reasonable explanation, judging from the the range of products and services that it offered, could be that it was a large scale co-operation with many subsidiaries. However, it could also be a red-flag for IUU as this would allow vessel owners to select the vessel flag state of a BO that would facilitate their illicit activities, such as gaining access to fisheries resources which are reserved for vessels owned by the local BO.</p>

<p><strong>Anomaly 3: BO of a seafood company, Baker and Sons, having a number of other unrelated businesses</strong></p>
<p>Other than owning another company (Faroe Islands Ltd Express) associated with seafood, we noticed one BO of Baker and Sons, Michael Johnson, owned a number of other companies there were unrelated to the seafood businesses. This structure was in contrast with the other 2 high revenue per BO entities as shown below, where the BOs only had 1 company to manage.</p>

<p>While having a BO with numerous businesses unrelated to fishing does not directly imply involvement in illegal fishing, there’s a possibility that such unrelated business could be a front to launder illicit gains from IUU or act as a false front for other illegal activities. Fisheye could consider analysing the entity’s financial transactions, including sources of funding, payment flows,to look for any suspicious patterns, such as large amounts of cash transactions or frequent transfers to offshore jurisdictions known for illegal fishing activities.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that the 2 top companies earning extra-ordinary revenue of OMU104m and OMU 63m were based in ZH.</p>

<p>From the network, only 7 out of 39 BOs had an alternate source of income from another company. There is no other data that discloses how the rest of the BOs earned their living. This raised some questions about their economic situation and sustainability, and if there are commercially justifiable reasons for having a large pool of BOs.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The lack of sufficient data hindered our ability to confirm our suspicion that some illicit activities were indeed taking place among the different business entities engaged in seafood commerce. However, we think our findings provide a solid basis for more in-depth investigation.</p>
<p>The exercise has been especially challenging, requiring a variety of data processing and manipulating technqiues ranging from natural language processing to social network analysis. This is on top of the visual analytics skills that we have to apply to detect anomalies. On the positive side, it has exposed us to different aspects of data science and how they can be integrated to solve complex problems.</p>
