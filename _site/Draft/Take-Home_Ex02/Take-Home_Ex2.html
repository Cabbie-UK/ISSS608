<p>We are unsure of the reasons behind the duplicate records and do not discount the possibility that they could be genuine. On balance, we find it unlikely that duplicate records exist for every day, with same weight and among the same pair of entities. Hence, we will use the <code>distinct()</code> function on the edge data to only retain only unique edge records for our analysis.</p>

<p>In the next section, we will take a deeper look at the evolution of the network, to understand how it has grown over the 7 years between entities in the industry. Before we begin, it’s crucial that we understand the visual cues that will be used so that we can appreciate the graphs</p>

<p><strong>Big Buyer 1: Volga River LLC Enterprises (Volga)</strong></p>
<p>Buyer Pattern: Only Buys from Bigger Suppliers</p>

</div>
<p>Volga, an entity that is probably based in Oceanus, has buying tunas from bigger suppliers based in other countries such as Mawazams and Merigrad. Given these, Volga is likely a company importing seafood. The businesses <strong>specialises in sourcing and importing tunas</strong> from suppliers located in other countries. They establish relationships with overseas seafood suppliers, which can include seafood processors, fishing companies, or seafood farms.</p>
<p>A check on the other exports shows that Volga does not export tunas overseas.</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-61CEFB59.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><strong>Big Buyer 2: hǎi dǎn Corporation Wharf (HD)</strong></p>
<p>Buying Pattern: Buys from a variety of sources, bigger and small suppliers</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-3FB051B4.png" class="img-fluid" width="581"></p>
<p>As seen from the image, HD sources its goods and products from many sources and suppliers. Unlike Volga, HD deals with a variety of seafood such as shrimps, tunas, other crustaceans from other countries.</p>
<p>A check on the edge records shows that starting in 2034, HD has exported a variety of seafood products overseas</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-EF815DED.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Given this profile, HD could be a seafood trading company or seafood brokerage. Seafood trading companies act as intermediaries between fishing boats, seafood suppliers, and customers. They purchase seafood directly from fishing boats locally and may also source seafood products from overseas suppliers. In addition, seafood trading companies often cater to a wide range of customers, including wholesalers, retailers, restaurants, and other food service providers.</p>
<p><strong>Big Supplier 1: Estrella de la Costa SRL (Estrella)</strong><br>
</p>
<p>Selling Pattern (more than badminton): Supplies a variety of seafood to various customers internationally</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-3EFBB095.png" class="img-fluid" width="676"> Estrella’s businesses is very similar to that of HD’s. It is a large trader of seafood products, with 8 of the 9 customers shown above coming from Oceanus.</p>
<p>A check on the edge records shows that it receives a variety of products from other countries as well</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-08BB43BE.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><strong>Big Supplier 2: LLC S.A. de C.V. (LLC)</strong></p>
<p>Selling Pattern: Providing crustaceans to just a handful of buyers</p>
<p><br>
<img src="images/paste-4FDB3118.png" class="img-fluid" width="660"></p>
<p>With the available information, LLC is likely a seafood exporter or seafood trading company. These businesses specialize in sourcing, purchasing, and distributing various types of seafood, including crustaceans like lobsters, crabs, shrimp, and crayfish, to customers worldwide. Given the limited imports based on the edges data (as shown in the table below), LLC probably deals more with with local fishermen, aquaculture farms, or seafood processors to secure a steady supply of crustaceans.</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-BCDC589A.png" class="img-fluid"><br>
</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>This analysis focuses on a subset of edge transactions that involve processed or preserved seafood products, based on their HS codes. By doing so, we can reveal the trading patterns of various trading entities and the business models they adopt. Creating meaningful network graphs is a challenging task that requires a lot of time and effort to explore and experiment with different options. However, the benefit is that we can discover patterns that are not easily visible using other types of visualisation.</p>
