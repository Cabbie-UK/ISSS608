<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="setting-the-scene">1.1 Setting the Scene</h2>
<p>City of Engagement, with a total population of 50,000, is a small city located at Country of Nowhere. The city serves as a service centre of an agriculture region surrounding the city. The main agriculture of the region is fruit farms and vineyards.</p>
<p>The city council is in the process of preparing the Local Plan 2023. A sample survey of representative residents had been conducted to collect data related to their household demographic and spending patterns, among other things. The city aims to use the data to assist with their major community revitalization efforts, including how to allocate a very large city renewal grant they have recently received.</p>

<section id="our-task" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="our-task">1.2 Our Task</h2>
<p>We are required to create a user-friendly and interactive solution to help city managers and planners to explore the complex data in an engaging way and reveal hidden patterns.</p>
<p>To this end, we will apply the concepts and methods learned from Lesson 1-4 of the course to reveal the <strong>demographic</strong> and <strong>financial characteristics</strong> of the city, using appropriate static and interactive statistical graphics methods.</p>

<p>From the above, we observe that majority of the participants have at least high school or college education. High literacy rate often correlates with higher knowledge-based economy and greater interest for cultural and intellectual activities. As we mouse over each column, we notice the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Average age across all education levels ranges from 38-40 years old</p></li>
<li><p>Average household size is around 2 persons</p></li>
<li><p>Higher degree of joviality seems to be associated with higher education level.</p></li>
</ul>

<li><p>With survey data, it’s useful to check the distribution of the data points for total wage and total expenses to get an intuition of how they differ for each education level. <code>stat_halfeye()</code> function is used to create half-density distribution for every education level</p></li>
<li><p>A boxplot, created using <code>geom_boxplot()</code>, shows the median and mean values on the chart to complements the analysis</p></li>

<p>It’s not surprising that the distribution of wages across all education levels are left-skewed. However, it’s worth noting that the wage distribution of participants who have tertiary education appear to be more evenly distributed than those who only receive College or lower education.</p>

<p>From the above, we observe that household size is small and the distribution of family sizes is also fairly proportionate, with about one-third of households having 1, 2 or 3 members each. As we mouse over the each column, we notice the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Only households with the size of 3 have kids</p></li>
<li><p>Joviality appears to be declining as the household size increases from 1 to 3</p></li>
<li><p>Similar to the split by education level, average age of participants across different household sizes ranges from 38 to 40 years old. This indicates that the age of participants in the survey is likely to be uniformly or normally distributed.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The relatively flat distribution for the age histogram above indicates slow population growth in the city, with the residents just reproducing enough to replace itself. Nonetheless, we have to check the survey’s participant identification criteria to ensure that the result above is not due to selection bias.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overall-distribution-of-joviality-index">4.4 Overall Distribution of Joviality Index</h2>
<p>It is meaningful to assess the sentiments of the 880 participants who have been around in the past year, as this provides valuable insights into the well-being and quality of life of the participants. The joviality measure can be used to identify factors that contribute to happiness, thus allowing city planners to prioritise resources in areas that have a positive impact on residents’ well-being.</p>

<p>We can see that distribution of the joviality index is left-skewed and both the median and mean index values are at 0.44 and 0.47 respectively. This indicates that those surveyed are not too pleased with their quality of live in the city and it is worth investigating the factors that influence the index.</p>
<p>How about the 131 survey participants who were only around in Mar 2022? Did they leave because they were unhappy too?</p>
<p>Let’s do a similar plot for them as well.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, the median and mean joviality index of the 131 participants who went “missing” after Mar 2022 is much higher. It’s definitely worth taking a deeper look into why this group of participants was happier.</p>

<h1>5.Validating the Joviality and Financial Health of the Participants</h1>
<p>Given that we are dealing with survey results, we will next conduct Confirmatory Data Analysis (CDA) to test and confirm some of the noteworthy observations from the previous section.</p>
<section id="whether-a-higher-education-qualification-results-in-more-wages" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="whether-a-higher-education-qualification-results-in-more-wages">5.1 Whether a higher education qualification results in more wages</h2>
<p>Before we start validating our hypotheses, we will develop a function that will help us visualise if the data is normally distributed using a Quantile-Quantile (QQ) Plot. At the same time, we also want to conduct a Shapiro-Wilk Test for Normality to confirm that the data points really follow a normal distribution. The function will make the repetitive task of generating a normality test result for each data set easier.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Accept inputs for a dataframe, categorical variable and a continuous measure that we will be applying the normality test on.</p></li>
<li><p>Accept inputs for the plot title and y-axis label.</p></li>
<li><p>Convert non-categorical variable into one that is categorical and also obtain the unique values of the variable</p></li>
<li><p>Draw a QQ plot based on the inputs</p></li>
<li><p>Compute the p-value for the Shapiro-Wilk Test and indicate if the data set is normally distributed based on the significance level of 0.05.</p></li>
<li><p>Annotate the Shapiro-Wilk Test result on the top-left of the QQ Plot . To reduce clutter, it is sufficient to just show the p-value and the test outcome on the plot</p></li>

<p>The p-value of the Kruskal-Willis Test is &lt; 0.05 and there is a statistically significant difference in total wages. This is further supported by the pairwise comparison of total wages between the education levels which shows significant differences in their wages among all levels.</p>
<p>With the above, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is sufficient statistical evidence that the wages of participants with different education levels are different.</p>

<p>The test results reveal that there is indeed a significant difference between the total expenses of participants who have kids and those who don’t and we will reject the null hypothesis.</p>
<p>Expenses are made up of Education, Shelter, Food and Recreation. We will dive deeper to understand which of these expense types resulted in the significant difference in the expenditure of the 2 groups.</p>
<p>To do this, we have to first extract the individual expenses items of the 880 participants for the year before charting an interval plot by expense type.</p>

<p>Based on the interval plot above, we see that all participants (with and without kids) have overlapping interval lines for food, recreation and shelter, indicating there is uncertainty on whether this is a significant difference in the median spend at 95% quantile for the 2 groups of participants on the 3 expense types.</p>
<p>It is also apparent that the spending on education , probably for the kids, is an expense item that participants without kids do not have to incur.</p>

<p>The p-value is &gt; 0.05 indicating that there is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the cost-to-wage ratio for larger households are different. Hence, we can also infer that even though we noticed families with kids incur higher expenses in Section 5.3, generally, the residents of these bigger households will earn more to defray the higher cost of living.</p>

<h1>6.Conclusion</h1>
<p>Through this exercise, we demonstrated how interactive and statistical plots can help us understand and analyse the survey data.</p>
<p>We explored the data in Section 4 using various visualisations to understand the distribution, relationships, and patterns in the data. We found that higher education level and bigger household size are associated with higher income and expenditure, the city has a low population growth rate, and the residents have a moderate level of happiness. We also performed statistical tests to confirm some of these findings and hypotheses. The analysis presented here is not exhaustive, but it should give city managers and planners a good overview of the demographic and financial situation of the city.</p>
