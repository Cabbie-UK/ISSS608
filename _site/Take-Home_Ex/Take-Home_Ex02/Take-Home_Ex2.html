<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="setting-the-scene">1.1 Setting the Scene</h2>
<p>The country of Oceanus has sought FishEye International’s help in identifying companies possibly engaged in illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing. As part of the collaboration, FishEye’s analysts received import/export data for Oceanus’ marine and fishing industries. However, Oceanus has informed FishEye that the data is incomplete. To facilitate their analysis, FishEye transformed the trade data into a knowledge graph. Using this knowledge graph, it hopes to understand business relationships, including finding links that will help stop IUU fishing and protect marine species that are affected by it.</p>

<p>We were unsure of the reasons behind the duplicate records and did not discount the possibility that they could be genuine. On balance, we found it unlikely that duplicate records exist for every day, with same weight and among the same pair of entities. Hence, we used the <code>distinct()</code> function on the edge data to only retain only unique edge records for our analysis.</p>

<p>The filtered edge records contain 8.9k entities with 538.2k links. A network of this size was too complex for us to conduct a meaningful analysis visually. As nodes within the same community tend to have more interactions among themselves than with nodes in other communities, we partitioned them into communities and then select one community to study. This made it easier to analyze the chosen community’s transformation over time and interpret the network’s organization,</p>

<p>We chose the community with id=14 for our analysis, which consists of 164 nodes/entities. This community is the second largest one in our dataset and it offers a good trade-off between complexity and clarity. We wanted to avoid a graph that is too dense or too sparse for our study.</p>

<h1>3.Identify temporal patterns for individual entities and between entities 🚢</h1>
<p>In this section, we took a closer look at the transformation of Community Id 14 from Year 2028 to 2034 to understand how entities in the industry interacted over the 7 years. Before we begin, it’s crucial that we understand the visual cues that are used to appreciate the graphs</p>

<li><p>Treemaps which encode the number of transaction (size) and quantities involved (by color intensity) for In-degree and Out-degree nodes</p></li>

<p>For David, we will notice that prior to Year 2031, its major suppliers were Norwegian King Crab Dockyard, Rift Valley fishery OJSC and Chhattisgarh S.A. de C.V. The trade relationship with these 3 suppliers stopped from Year 2031 and since then, David appeared to have scaled down its operations and not buying as much as before.</p>

<p><strong>Reseller 1: 84,Ltd.&nbsp;Liability Co Corp (Ltd)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Business relationship pattern</strong>: Traded in various seafood produce as an re-seller</p>
<p>(Image 5: Direct Trading Network of Ltd)</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-6F70BF18.png" class="img-fluid" width="558"></p>
<p>Ltd did not trade with with primary suppliers directly. Instead, it played an intermediary role, acquiring its goods and products from 2 other re-sellers before supplying them to end buyers. In the temporal analysis, we noted that Ltd existed from the community in Year 2032, 3 years after its appearance in Year 2029. Thereafter, it became active again in Year 2034.</p>
<p><strong>Re-seller 2: 144, Spanish Anchovy CJSC Marine (Spanish)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Business relationship pattern</strong>: Trader of various seafood produce</p>
<p>(Image 6: Direct Trading Network of Spanish)</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-062FA276.png" class="img-fluid" width="604"></p>
<p>Unlike Ltd, Spanish sourced its goods direct from suppliers acting much like a seasfood trading company or brokerage. Seafood trading companies act as intermediaries between fishing boats, seafood suppliers, and customers. They purchase seafood directly from fishing boats locally and may also source seafood products from overseas suppliers. In addition, seafood trading companies often cater to a wide range of customers, including wholesalers, retailers, restaurants, and other food service providers.</p>

<h1>5.Conclusion 🐟</h1>
<p>This analysis focuses on a subset of edge transactions that involve live, fresh, chilled, frozen seafood products, based on selected HS codes within a chosen community. By doing so, we focused on and uncovered the trading patterns of various entities and the business models they adopted within the community. Although we found some re-sellers suspicious of being involved in transshipment, it would be premature to conclude that the transactions involved IUU fishing.</p>
<p>Creating meaningful network graphs is a challenging task that requires a lot of time and effort to explore and experiment with different options. However, the benefit is that we can discover patterns that are not easily visible using other types of visualisation.</p>
