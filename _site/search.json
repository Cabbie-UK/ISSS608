There is no (user accessible) representation of the graphics, apart from their appearance on the screen. Base graphics includes both tools for drawing primitives and entire plots. Base graphics functions are generally fast, but have limited scope.\nOn the other hand, ggplot2 has an underlying grammar, based on the Grammar of Graphics (see sections below), that allows us to compose graphs by combining independent components. This makes ggplot2 powerful. Rather than being limited to sets of pre-defined graphics, we can create novel graphics that are tailored to our specific problem."

    "text": "1.4 Grammar of Graphics\nGrammar of Graphics is a general scheme for data visualization which breaks up graphs into semantic components such as scales and layers. It was introduced by Leland Wilkinson (1999) .\nIn brief, the grammar tells us that a graphic maps the data to the aesthetic attributes (colour, shape, size) of geometric objects (points, lines, bars). The plot may also include statistical transformations of the data and information about the plot’s coordinate system. Facetting can be used to plot for different subsets of the data. The combination of these independent components are what make up a graphic.\n\n1.4.1 A Layered Grammar of Graphics\nThe 7 layers are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData: Refers to the data-set being plotted\nAesthetics: Use the attributes of the data to influence visual characteristics, such as position, colours, size, shape, or transparency.\nGeometrics: Represent our data using visual elements such as points, bar or line.\nFacets: Split the data into subsets to create small multiples of the same graph (paneling, multiple plots).\nStatistics:Apply additional statistical transformations that summarise the data (e.g. mean, confidence intervals).\nCoordinates: Define the pane on which data is mapped on the graphic.\nTheme: Modify all non-data components of a plot, such as main title, sub-title, y-aixs title, legend, and background.\n\nThe purpose of each layer (or component) is further discussed below."

There is one scale for each aesthetic mapping in a plot. The scale is also responsible for creating a guide, an axis or legend, that allows us to read the plot, converting aesthetic values back into data values.\nIf we want to set an aesthetic to a fixed value, without scaling it, do so in the individual layer outside of aes(). Refer to section 1.7.4.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.7.6 Geometric Object: geom_density\ngeom-density() computes and plots kernel density estimate, which is a smoothed version of the histogram.\nIt is a useful alternative to the histogram for continuous data that comes from an underlying smooth distribution.\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_density()           \n\n\n\n\n\nWe can plot two kernel density lines by using colour or fill arguments of aes().\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS, \n           colour = GENDER)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.7.7 Geometric Object: geom_boxplot\ngeom_boxplot() displays continuous value list.

The notch indicates a confidence interval around the median, calculated using the median absolute deviation. If the notches of two box plots do not overlap, it suggests that the medians of the two groups are significantly different. We can show the indentation using the notch argument.\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.7.8 Geometric Object: geom_violin\ngeom_violin is designed for creating violin plot. With ordinary density curves (see section 1.7.6), it is difficult to compare more than just a few distributions because the lines visually interfere with each other. With a violin plot, it’s easier to compare several distributions since they’re placed side by side.\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_violin()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.7.9 Geometric Object: geom_point\ngeom_point() is especially useful for creating scatterplot.\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point()            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.7.10 Combine several geom objects\nFor instance, we can plot the data points on the boxplots by using both geom_boxplot() and geom_point().\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +                    \n  geom_point(position=\"jitter\", \n             size = 0.5)"

    "text": "3.3 Interactive Data Visualisation\n\n3.3.1 Working with ggiraph package\nggiraph is an htmlwidget and a ggplot2 extension. In ggplot2, interactivity can be added to a plot through the use of ggplot geometries. There are 3 arguments that can be used to enable interactivity in ggplot geometries:\n\ntooltip: To display a tooltip when the mouse is hovered over elements of the plot. Tooltips can be customized to include any information that is relevant to the plot.\nonclick: To specify an embedded JavaScript function that is executed when chart element is clicked.\ndata_id: To link a graph element to a record via a data_id. The data_id is a unique identifier for each record in the data, and it is used to enable interactivity between the plot and other components of the application.\nWhen used within a Shiny application, elements associated with an id (data_id) can be selected and manipulated on the client and server. The list of selected values will be stored in in a reactive value named [shiny_id]_selected.\n\n\n3.3.1.1 The tooltip argument\nFirst, an interactive version of ggplot2 geom (i.e. geom_dotplot_interactive()) will be used to create the basic graph. Next, girafe() of ggiraph is used to create an interactive Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) object to display the plot on a html page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a SVG?\n\n\n\nSVG is an XML-based format that is commonly used for web graphics and interactive visualizations because it allows graphics to be resized without losing quality.\n\n\n👇Interactivity: By hovering the mouse pointer on an data point of interest, the student’s ID will be displayed.\n\n\nShow the code\np <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = ID),\n    #  Specifies that the dots will be stacked on top of each other when they overlap\n    stackgroups = TRUE, \n    binwidth = 1,\n    # Specifies the method for plotting the dot plot\n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  # NULL: Specifies that the y-axis label will be blank.\n  # breaks = NULL: Specifies that no tick marks will be displayed on the y-axis\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL, \n                     breaks = NULL)\n\ngirafe(\n  # Specifies the ggplot2 plot p that will be converted to an interactive plot using girafe\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6*0.618\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisplay more information on tooltip\nHere, we included the student’s class in the tooltip.\nThe first three lines of codes below create a new field called tooltip. Text data in the ID and CLASS fields are assigned to the newly created field.

    "text": "4.1 Learning Outcome\nWhen telling a visually-driven data story, animated graphics tends to attract the interest of the audience and make deeper impression than static graphics. We will learn to create animated data visualisation. At the same time, we will also learn to reshape, process, wrangle and transform the data-set.\n\n4.1.1 Basic concept of animation\nWhen creating animations, the plot does not actually move. Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames, just like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot, which is built using a relevant subset of the data-set. Motion (and the animated effect) appears when the stitched plots are displayed sequentially.\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Terminologies\nBefore we dive into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it’s important to understand some of the key concepts and terminologies that will be used:\n\nFrame: In an animated line graph, each frame represents a different point in time or a different category. When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.\nAnimation Attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves. For example, we can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function used to transit between frames, and whether to start the animation from the current frame or from the beginning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen do we use animated graphs?\n\n\n\nBefore we start making animated graphs, we should first ask ourselves: Does it makes sense to go through the effort? If we are conducting an exploratory data analysis, a animated graphic may not be worth the time investment. However, if we are giving a presentation, a few well-placed animated graphics can help an audience connect with our topic remarkably better than static counterparts."

Read on to see the magic of animated charts 😜.\n\n\n\n4.3.1 Working with gganimate package\ngganimate extends the grammar of graphics as implemented by ggplot2 to include the description of animation. It does this by providing a range of new grammar classes that can be added to the plot object in order to customise how it should change with time.\n\ntransition_*() defines how the data should be spread out and how it relates to itself across time.\nview_*() defines how the positional scales should change along the animation.\nshadow_*() defines how data from other points in time should be presented in the given point in time.\nenter_*()/exit_*() defines how new data should appear and how old data should disappear during the course of the animation.\nease_aes() defines how different aesthetics should be eased during transitions.\n\nBuilding the animated bubble plot\nIn the following chart:\n\ntransition_time() is used to create transition through distinct states in time (i.e. Year).\nease_aes() is used to control easing of aesthetics. The default is linear. Other methods are: quadratic, cubic, quartic, quintic, sine, circular, exponential, elastic, back, and bounce.\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young, \n                      size = Population, \n                      colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', \n       x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') +\n  transition_time(Year) +       \n  ease_aes(y = 'linear')          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Working with plotly package\nIn Plotly R package, both ggplotly() and plot_ly() support key frame animations through the frame argument/aesthetic. They also support an ids argument/aesthetic to ensure smooth transitions between objects with the same id (which helps facilitate object constancy).\nIn the following graph, ggplotly() is used to convert the ggplot2 graph into an animated object.\nggplotly(gg)\n\n\nShow the code\ngg <- ggplot(globalPop, \n       aes(x = Old, \n           y = Young, \n           size = Population, \n           colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(aes(size = Population,\n                 frame = Year),\n             alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') +\n  theme(legend.position='none')\n\nggplotly(gg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this next graph, we will use plot_ly() function to create the animated bubble plot.\n\n\nShow the code\nbp <- globalPop %>%\n  plot_ly(x = ~Old, \n          y = ~Young, \n          size = ~Population, \n          color = ~Continent, \n          frame = ~Year, \n          text = ~Country, \n          hoverinfo = \"text\",\n          type = 'scatter',\n          mode = 'markers'\n          )\nbp"

    "text": "5.3 Visual Statistical Analysis with ggstatsplot package\nggstatsplot is an extension of ggplot2 package for creating graphics enriched with statistical test details. It:\n\nProvides alternative statistical inference methods by default.\nFollows the best practices for statistical reporting. For all statistical tests reported in the plots, the default template abides by the APA gold standard for statistical reporting. For example, here are the results from a t-test:\n\n\n\n5.3.1 Import the data\nWe will be using the same exam scores data-set that was featured in my Hands-On Exercise for Week 1.\n\n\nShow the code\nexam <- read_csv('data/Exam_data.csv', show_col_types = FALSE )\n\n\n\n\n5.3.2 One-sample Mean Test\nWe use gghistostats() to to build an visual of one-sample test on English scores.\nIn the following case:\n\ntype = \"bayes\": specifies the type of statistical test to perform on the data to generate the interval estimate. In this case, it is a Bayesian analysis, which provides a posterior distribution of plausible values based on prior knowledge and observed data.\ntest.value = 60: specifies the value for the null hypothesis that will be used to calculate the probability of the observed data. In this case, it is 60, which assumes that the average English score is 60.\n\n\n\nShow the code\nset.seed(1234)\n\ngghistostats(\n  data = exam,\n  x = ENGLISH,\n  type = \"bayes\",\n  test.value = 60,\n  xlab = \"English scores\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nUnpacking the Bayes Factor\nA Bayes factor is the ratio of the likelihood of one particular hypothesis to the likelihood of another. It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories.\nThe Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.\nWhen we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10. It can be defined mathematically as:\n\nThe Schwarz criterion is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough approximation of the Bayes Factor.\nHow to interpret Bayes Factor\nA Bayes Factor can be any positive number. One of the most common interpretations is this one—first proposed by Harold Jeffereys (1961) and slightly modified by Lee and Wagenmakers in 2013: \n\n\n5.3.3 Two-sample Mean Test\nNext, we use ggbetweenstats() to build a visual for two-sample mean test of Maths scores by gender. This generates a combination of box and violin plots along with jittered data points for between-subjects designs with statistical details included in the plot as a subtitle.\nIn the following case:\n\ntype = \"np\": specifies the type of test to be used to compare the groups, in this case, a non-parametric test (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test).\nmessages = FALSE: specifies whether or not to display informative messages about the statistical test being performed.\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggbetweenstats(\n  data = exam,\n  x = GENDER, \n  y = MATHS,\n  type = \"np\",\n  messages = FALSE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.4 One-way ANOVA Test\nWe can also use ggbetweenstats() to build a visual for One-way ANOVA test on English score by race.\nIn the following case:\n\ntype = \"p\": specifies the type of test to be used to compare the groups, in this case, a parametric test (one-way ANOVA).\nmean.ci = TRUE: specifies whether or not to display confidence intervals for the group means.\npairwise.comparisons = TRUE: specifies whether or not to display pairwise comparisons between the groups.\npairwise.display = \"s\": specifies the format of the pairwise comparison display, in this case, “s” for compact letter display.\np.adjust.method = \"fdr\": specifies the method used for p-value adjustment for multiple comparisons, in this case, false discovery rate (FDR) correction.\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggbetweenstats(\n  data = exam,\n  x = RACE, \n  y = ENGLISH,\n  type = \"p\",\n  mean.ci = TRUE, \n  pairwise.comparisons = TRUE, \n  pairwise.display = \"s\",\n  p.adjust.method = \"fdr\",\n  messages = FALSE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of tests with ggbetweenstats\n  \n\n\n5.3.5 Significant Test of Correlation\nWe can use ggscatterstats() to build a visual for Significant Test of Correlation between Maths scores and English scores. This creates a scatter plot with overlaid regression lines between the variables “MATHS” and “ENGLISH” in the “exam” dataset.\nIn the following case:\n\nmarginal = TRUE: specifies whether or not to display marginal histograms or density plots along the axes of the scatter plot. In this case, marginal plots are not displayed.\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggscatterstats(\n  data = exam,\n  x = MATHS,\n  y = ENGLISH,\n  marginal = TRUE,\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.5 Significant Test of Association (Dependence)\nFirst, we bin the Maths scores into a 4-class variable using cut() function.\n\n\nShow the code\nexam1 <- exam %>% \n  mutate(MATHS_bins = cut(MATHS, \n               breaks = c(0,60,75,85,100))\n  )\n\n\nWe use ggbarstats() to build a visual for Significant Test of Association between the categorised Maths scores and gender.\n\n\nShow the code\nggbarstats(exam1, \n           x = MATHS_bins, \n           y = GENDER)"

    "text": "7.3 FunnelPlotR methods\nFunnelPlotR package uses ggplot to generate funnel plots. It requires a numerator (events of interest), denominator (population to be considered) and group. The key arguments selected for customisation are:\n\nlimit: plot limits (95 or 99).\nlabel_outliers: label outliers (true or false).\nPoisson_limits: add Poisson limits to the plot.\nOD_adjust: add overdispersed limits to the plot.\nxrange and yrange: specify the range to display for axes, acts like a zoom function.\nOther aesthetic components such as graph title, axis labels etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I interpret a funnel plot?\n\n\n\nCheck out this video which explains the elements of the funnel plot and how it is constructed.\n\n\n\n7.3.1 FunnelPlotR methods: The Basic Plot\nWe use the funnel_plot() function to create a basic plot. Things to note:\n\ngroup argument is different from that in the scatterplot. Here, it specifics the level of the points to be plotted i.e. Sub-district, District or City. If City is chosen, there will only be six data points.\nBy default, data_typeargument is “SR”.\nlimit: the accepted plot limit values are: 95 or 99, corresponding to 95% or 99.8% quantiles of the distribution.\n\n\n\nShow the code\nfunnel_plot(\n  numerator = covid19$Positive,\n  denominator = covid19$Death,\n  group = covid19$`Sub-district`\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nA funnel plot object with 267 points of which 0 are outliers. \nPlot is adjusted for overdispersion. \n\n\n\n\n7.3.2 FunnelPlotR methods: Makeover Part 1\nWe updated the arguments used in the funnel_plot() function to create the following plot:\n\ndata_type: A character string specifying the type of data to be plotted. In this case, it is set to “PR”, which stands for proportion or percentage, indicating that the data in the numerator and denominator arguments are in the form of proportions or percentages, and not absolute counts.\nx_range: A numeric vector of length two specifying the range of the x-axis of the plot. Here, it is set to c(0, 6500), which means the x-axis ranges from 0 to 6500.\ny_range: A numeric vector of length two specifying the range of the y-axis of the plot. Here, it is set to c(0, 0.05), which means the y-axis ranges from 0 to 0.05.\n\n\n\nShow the code\nfunnel_plot(\n  numerator = covid19$Death,\n  denominator = covid19$Positive,\n  group = covid19$`Sub-district`,\n  data_type = \"PR\",     #<<\n  x_range = c(0, 6500),  #<<\n  y_range = c(0, 0.05)   #<<\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nA funnel plot object with 267 points of which 7 are outliers. \nPlot is adjusted for overdispersion. \n\n\n\n\n7.3.3 FunnelPlotR methods: Makeover Part 2\nFurther updates to the relevant arguments of the funnel_plot() function are:\n\nlabel: A logical value indicating whether or not to display the group labels on the plot. Here, it is set to NA, which means that no labels will be displayed.\ntitle: A character string specifying the title of the plot. Here, it is set to “COVID-19 Fatality Rate by Total Number of COVID-19 Positive Cases”.\nx_label: A character string specifying the label for the x-axis of the plot. Here, it is set to “COVID-19 Positive Cases”.\ny_label: A character string specifying the label for the y-axis of the plot. Here, it is set to “Fatality Rate”.\n\n\n\nShow the code\nfunnel_plot(\n  numerator = covid19$Death,\n  denominator = covid19$Positive,\n  group = covid19$`Sub-district`,\n  data_type = \"PR\",   \n  x_range = c(0, 6500),  \n  y_range = c(0, 0.05),\n  label = NA,\n  title = \"COVID-19 Fatality Rate by Total Number of COVID-19 Positive Cases\", #<<           \n  x_label = \"COVID-19 Positive Cases\", #<<\n  y_label = \"Fatality Rate\"  #<<\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nA funnel plot object with 267 points of which 7 are outliers. \nPlot is adjusted for overdispersion."

For the 2nd and 3rd comment, we first summarise the data-set using group_by() and summarise() function to get the count of pupils by race. Thereafter, we use the reorder() function to sort the columns and geom_text() function to display the count.\n\nBeforeAfter\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data=exam_data, aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  ylim(0,220) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\n# Group the data by Race and aggregate by pupil count\nsorted_data <- exam_data %>% group_by(RACE) %>% summarise(count=n()) \n\n# Plot the chart\nggplot(data = sorted_data, aes(x=reorder(RACE, -count),y=count)) +\n  ylim(0,220) +\n  geom_col() +\n  ylab('No. of\\nPupils') +\n  theme(axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 0, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))+\n  xlab('Race') +\n  geom_text(aes(label = count), vjust = -0.5, size = 3.5) +\n  labs(title = \"Chinese Pupils Formed The Bulk Of The Cohort\",\n       subtitle = \"This was followed by Malay and Indian pupils\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.3 Add mean and median lines on the histogram\nWe can use the geom_vline() function to add a computed mean and median line onto the chart.\n\nBeforeAfter\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 20)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 color=\"black\", \n                 fill=\"light blue\") +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(MATHS, na.rm=T)),\n             color=\"red\", \n             linetype=\"dashed\", \n             size=1) +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=median(MATHS, na.rm=T)),\n             color=\"grey30\",\n             linetype=\"dashed\", \n             size=1) +\n            xlab('Maths Score') +\n            ylab('Count') +\n  annotate(\"label\", color = \"red\", x=mean(exam_data$MATHS, na.rm=T)+2, y=50,\n          label=paste(\"Mean: \", round(mean(exam_data$MATHS, na.rm=T), 1)),fill = \"white\") +\n  annotate(\"label\",color=\"grey30\", x=median(exam_data$MATHS, na.rm=T)+2, y=40,\n          label=paste(\"Median: \", round(median(exam_data$MATHS, na.rm=T), 1)),fill = \"white\") + \n  labs(title = \"The Median score for Maths exam was 74\",\n         subtitle = \"We have a small porpotion of pupils who scored less than 25 marks\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.4 Make the basic histogram more informative\nThe histograms below are elegantly designed but not informative. This is because they only reveal the distribution of English scores by gender but without context such as the score distribution for all pupils.\nTo show the distribution of English scores for all pupils as the background, we can add another geom_histogram() layer for all pupils.\n\nBeforeAfter\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data=exam_data, aes(x = ENGLISH )) +\n  geom_histogram() +\n  facet_wrap(~ GENDER) +\n  guides(fill = FALSE) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nd <- exam_data\n\n#create a d_bg dataframe without the gender attribute\nd_bg <- d[, -3]  \n\nggplot(d, aes(x = ENGLISH, fill = GENDER)) +\n  geom_histogram(data = d_bg, fill = \"grey\", alpha = .5) +\n  geom_histogram(colour = \"black\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ GENDER) +\n  # guides = false removes the legend from the chart\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Female\" = \"pink\", \"Male\" = \"light blue\")) +\n  guides(fill = FALSE) +  \n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(title = \"Female pupils scored higher marks than male pupils for English\",\n         subtitle = \"Their score distn covered the overall score distn for all pupuls on the right side fo the chart\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.5 Dividing a chart into 4 quadrants\nWe can use geom_hline() and geom_vline() to divide the chart into equal quadrants (see After(1)). At the same time, we can use the coord_cartesian() function to adjust the limits of the coordinate system for a plot to only display the data that falls within those limits.\nIn After (2), I included a regression line and swtich the background to white (using theme_minimal()) to make the relationship between English and Math scores more prominent.\n\nBeforeAfter (1)After (2)\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(20,99))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100)) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=50,\n             linetype=\"dashed\",\n             color=\"grey60\",\n             size=1) + \n  geom_vline(xintercept=50, \n             linetype=\"dashed\",\n             color=\"grey60\",\n             size=1) +\n  labs(title = \"Pupils who did well in English tend to excel in Math as well\",\n         subtitle = \"There is a positive correlation between English and Math scores\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100)) +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm,linewidth=1.0)  +\n  labs(title = \"Pupils who did well in English tend to excel in Math as well\",\n         subtitle = \"There is a positive correlation between English and Math scores\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(**That's\\) \\(all\\) \\(folks!**\\)"
