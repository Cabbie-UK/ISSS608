For the 2nd and 3rd comment, we first summarise the data-set using group_by() and summarise() function to get the count of pupils by race. Thereafter, we use the reorder() function to sort the columns and geom_text() function to display the count.\n\nBeforeAfter\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data=exam_data, aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  ylim(0,220) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\n# Group the data by Race and aggregate by pupil count\nsorted_data <- exam_data %>% group_by(RACE) %>% summarise(count=n()) \n\n# Plot the chart\nggplot(data = sorted_data, aes(x=reorder(RACE, -count),y=count)) +\n  ylim(0,220) +\n  geom_col() +\n  ylab('No. of\\nPupils') +\n  theme(axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 0, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))+\n  xlab('Race') +\n  geom_text(aes(label = count), vjust = -0.5, size = 3.5) +\n  labs(title = \"Chinese Pupils Formed The Bulk Of The Cohort\",\n       subtitle = \"This was followed by Malay and Indian pupils\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.3 Add mean and median lines on the histogram\nWe can use the geom_vline() function to add a computed mean and median line onto the chart.\n\nBeforeAfter\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 20)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 color=\"black\", \n                 fill=\"light blue\") +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(MATHS, na.rm=T)),\n             color=\"red\", \n             linetype=\"dashed\", \n             size=1) +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=median(MATHS, na.rm=T)),\n             color=\"grey30\",\n             linetype=\"dashed\", \n             size=1) +\n            xlab('Maths Score') +\n            ylab('Count') +\n  annotate(\"label\", color = \"red\", x=mean(exam_data$MATHS, na.rm=T)+2, y=50,\n          label=paste(\"Mean: \", round(mean(exam_data$MATHS, na.rm=T), 1)),fill = \"white\") +\n  annotate(\"label\",color=\"grey30\", x=median(exam_data$MATHS, na.rm=T)+2, y=40,\n          label=paste(\"Median: \", round(median(exam_data$MATHS, na.rm=T), 1)),fill = \"white\") + \n  labs(title = \"The Median score for Maths exam was 74\",\n         subtitle = \"We have a small porpotion of pupils who scored less than 25 marks\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.4 Make the basic histogram more informative\nThe histograms below are elegantly designed but not informative. This is because they only reveal the distribution of English scores by gender but without context such as the score distribution for all pupils.\nTo show the distribution of English scores for all pupils as the background, we can add another geom_histogram() layer for all pupils.\n\nBeforeAfter\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data=exam_data, aes(x = ENGLISH )) +\n  geom_histogram() +\n  facet_wrap(~ GENDER) +\n  guides(fill = FALSE) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nd <- exam_data\n\n#create a d_bg dataframe without the gender attribute\nd_bg <- d[, -3]  \n\nggplot(d, aes(x = ENGLISH, fill = GENDER)) +\n  geom_histogram(data = d_bg, fill = \"grey\", alpha = .5) +\n  geom_histogram(colour = \"black\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ GENDER) +\n  # guides = false removes the legend from the chart\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Female\" = \"pink\", \"Male\" = \"light blue\")) +\n  guides(fill = FALSE) +  \n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(title = \"Female pupils scored higher marks than male pupils for English\",\n         subtitle = \"Their score distn covered the overall score distn for all pupuls on the right side fo the chart\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.5 Dividing a chart into 4 quadrants\nWe can use geom_hline() and geom_vline() to divide the chart into equal quadrants (see After(1)). At the same time, we can use the coord_cartesian() function to adjust the limits of the coordinate system for a plot to only display the data that falls within those limits.\nIn After (2), I included a regression line and swtich the background to white (using theme_minimal()) to make the relationship between English and Math scores more prominent.\n\nBeforeAfter (1)After (2)\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(20,99))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100)) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=50,\n             linetype=\"dashed\",\n             color=\"grey60\",\n             size=1) + \n  geom_vline(xintercept=50, \n             linetype=\"dashed\",\n             color=\"grey60\",\n             size=1) +\n  labs(title = \"Pupils who did well in English tend to excel in Math as well\",\n         subtitle = \"There is a positive correlation between English and Math scores\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100)) +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm,linewidth=1.0)  +\n  labs(title = \"Pupils who did well in English tend to excel in Math as well\",\n         subtitle = \"There is a positive correlation between English and Math scores\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(**That's\\) \\(all\\) \\(folks!**\\)"

    "text": "3.3 Interactive Data Visualisation\n\n3.3.1 Working with ggiraph package\nggiraph is an htmlwidget and a ggplot2 extension. In ggplot2, interactivity can be added to a plot through the use of ggplot geometries. There are 3 arguments that can be used to enable interactivity in ggplot geometries:\n\ntooltip: To display a tooltip when the mouse is hovered over elements of the plot. Tooltips can be customized to include any information that is relevant to the plot.\nonclick: To specify an embedded JavaScript function that is executed when chart element is clicked.\ndata_id: To link a graph element to a record via a data_id. The data_id is a unique identifier for each record in the data, and it is used to enable interactivity between the plot and other components of the application.\nWhen used within a Shiny application, elements associated with an id (data_id) can be selected and manipulated on the client and server. The list of selected values will be stored in in a reactive value named [shiny_id]_selected.\n\n\n3.3.1.1 The tooltip argument\nFirst, an interactive version of ggplot2 geom (i.e. geom_dotplot_interactive()) will be used to create the basic graph. Next, girafe() of ggiraph is used to create an interactive Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) object to display the plot on a html page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a SVG?\n\n\n\nSVG is an XML-based format that is commonly used for web graphics and interactive visualizations because it allows graphics to be resized without losing quality.\n\n\n👇Interactivity: By hovering the mouse pointer on an data point of interest, the student’s ID will be displayed.\n\n\nShow the code\np <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = ID),\n    #  Specifies that the dots will be stacked on top of each other when they overlap\n    stackgroups = TRUE, \n    binwidth = 1,\n    # Specifies the method for plotting the dot plot\n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  # NULL: Specifies that the y-axis label will be blank.\n  # breaks = NULL: Specifies that no tick marks will be displayed on the y-axis\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL, \n                     breaks = NULL)\n\ngirafe(\n  # Specifies the ggplot2 plot p that will be converted to an interactive plot using girafe\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6*0.618\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisplay more information on tooltip\nHere, we included the student’s class in the tooltip.\nThe first three lines of codes below create a new field called tooltip. Text data in the ID and CLASS fields are assigned to the newly created field.

It sets a variety of options for brushing (i.e., highlighting) multiple plots. These options are primarily designed for linking multiple plotly graphs, and may not behave as expected when linking plotly to another htmlwidget package via crosstalk. In some cases, other htmlwidgets will respect these options, such as persistent selection in leaflet.\nbscols() is a helper function of crosstalk package. It makes it easy to put HTML elements side by side. It can be called directly from the console but is especially designed to work in an R Markdown document.\n\n(Select a cluster of points from the scatterplot and the data table will return the records of the selected data points)\n\n\nShow the code\nd <- highlight_key(exam_data) \n\np <- ggplot(d, \n            aes(ENGLISH, \n                MATHS)) + \n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\n\ngg <- highlight(ggplotly(p),        \n                \"plotly_selected\")  \n\ncrosstalk::bscols(gg,               \n                  DT::datatable(d),\n                  widths = 12)"

The data was extracted from World Development Indicators Database of World Bank.\nWorldCountry.csv provides a list of country names and the continent they belong to extracted from Statistics Times.\n\n\n\nShow the code\nGDP <- read_csv(\"data/GDP.csv\")\nWorldCountry <- read_csv(\"data/WorldCountry.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstand the data-set\n\n\n\nIt is always a good practice to check the data structure and examine data values in RStudio.\n\n\n\n3.5.1 Data preparation\nBefore generating the data visualisation, it is important for us to reshape, wrangle and transform the raw data to meet the data visualisation needs. The following data manipulation function will come in handy:\n\nmutate() of dplyr package is used to convert all values in the 202 field into numeric data type.\nselect() of dplyr package is used to extract column 1 to 3 and Values field.\npivot_wider() of tidyr package is used to split the values in Series Name field into columns.\nleft_join() of dplyr package is used to perform a left-join by using Country Code of GDP_selected and ISO-alpha3 Code of WorldCountry tibble data tables as unique identifier.\n\n\n\nShow the code\nGDP_selected <- GDP %>%\n  mutate(Values = as.numeric(`2020`)) %>%\n  select(1:3, Values) %>%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = `Series Name`,\n              values_from = `Values`) %>%\n  left_join(y=WorldCountry, by = c(\"Country Code\" = \"ISO-alpha3 Code\"))\n\n\n\n\n3.5.2 Working with packed bar package\n\npacked bar is a relatively new data visualisation method introduced by Xan Gregg from JMP.\nIt supports the need of visualising skewed data over hundreds of categories.\nThe idea is to support the Focus+Context data visualization principle.\nVisit this JMP Blog to learn more about the design principles of packed bar.\n\nData preparation for packed bar\n\n\nShow the code\nGDP_selected <- GDP %>%\n  mutate(GDP = as.numeric(`2020`)) %>%\n  filter(`Series Name` == \"GDP (current US$)\") %>%\n  select(1:2, GDP) %>%\n  na.omit()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurpose of na.omit() in the code\n\n\n\n\nna.omit() is used to exclude rows with missing values. This is because rPackedBar package does not support missing values.\n\n\n\nWe use plotly_packed_bar() of rPackedBar package to create an interactive packed bar.\n\n\nShow the code\np = plotly_packed_bar(\n  input_data = GDP_selected,\n  label_column = \"Country Name\",\n  value_column = \"GDP\",\n  number_rows = 10,\n  plot_title = \"Top 10 countries by GDP, 2020\",\n  xaxis_label = \"GDP (US$)\",\n  hover_label = \"GDP\",\n  min_label_width = 0.018,\n  color_bar_color = \"#00aced\",\n  label_color = \"white\")\nplotly::config(p, displayModeBar = FALSE)\n\n\n\nRead this Vignettes and the user guide to learn more about the package."
