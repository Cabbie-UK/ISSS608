There is no (user accessible) representation of the graphics, apart from their appearance on the screen. Base graphics includes both tools for drawing primitives and entire plots. Base graphics functions are generally fast, but have limited scope.\nOn the other hand, ggplot2 has an underlying grammar, based on the Grammar of Graphics (see sections below), that allows us to compose graphs by combining independent components. This makes ggplot2 powerful. Rather than being limited to sets of pre-defined graphics, we can create novel graphics that are tailored to our specific problem."

    "text": "1.4 Grammar of Graphics\nGrammar of Graphics is a general scheme for data visualization which breaks up graphs into semantic components such as scales and layers. It was introduced by Leland Wilkinson (1999) .\nIn brief, the grammar tells us that a graphic maps the data to the aesthetic attributes (colour, shape, size) of geometric objects (points, lines, bars). The plot may also include statistical transformations of the data and information about the plot’s coordinate system. Facetting can be used to plot for different subsets of the data. The combination of these independent components are what make up a graphic.\n\n1.4.1 A Layered Grammar of Graphics\nThe 7 layers are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData: Refers to the data-set being plotted\nAesthetics: Use the attributes of the data to influence visual characteristics, such as position, colours, size, shape, or transparency.\nGeometrics: Represent our data using visual elements such as points, bar or line.\nFacets: Split the data into subsets to create small multiples of the same graph (paneling, multiple plots).\nStatistics:Apply additional statistical transformations that summarise the data (e.g. mean, confidence intervals).\nCoordinates: Define the pane on which data is mapped on the graphic.\nTheme: Modify all non-data components of a plot, such as main title, sub-title, y-aixs title, legend, and background.\n\nThe purpose of each layer (or component) is further discussed below."

There is one scale for each aesthetic mapping in a plot. The scale is also responsible for creating a guide, an axis or legend, that allows us to read the plot, converting aesthetic values back into data values.\nIf we want to set an aesthetic to a fixed value, without scaling it, do so in the individual layer outside of aes(). Refer to section 1.7.4.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.7.6 Geometric Object: geom_density\ngeom-density() computes and plots kernel density estimate, which is a smoothed version of the histogram.\nIt is a useful alternative to the histogram for continuous data that comes from an underlying smooth distribution.\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_density()           \n\n\n\n\n\nWe can plot two kernel density lines by using colour or fill arguments of aes().\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS, \n           colour = GENDER)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.7.7 Geometric Object: geom_boxplot\ngeom_boxplot() displays continuous value list.

The notch indicates a confidence interval around the median, calculated using the median absolute deviation. If the notches of two box plots do not overlap, it suggests that the medians of the two groups are significantly different. We can show the indentation using the notch argument.\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.7.8 Geometric Object: geom_violin\ngeom_violin is designed for creating violin plot. With ordinary density curves (see section 1.7.6), it is difficult to compare more than just a few distributions because the lines visually interfere with each other. With a violin plot, it’s easier to compare several distributions since they’re placed side by side.\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_violin()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.7.9 Geometric Object: geom_point\ngeom_point() is especially useful for creating scatterplot.\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point()            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.7.10 Combine several geom objects\nFor instance, we can plot the data points on the boxplots by using both geom_boxplot() and geom_point().\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +                    \n  geom_point(position=\"jitter\", \n             size = 0.5)"

It allows ggplot graphics to be interactive.\nInteractivity is added to ggplot geometries, legends and theme elements, via the following aesthetics:\n\ntooltip: tooltips are displayed when the mouse is hovered over elements.\nonclick: JavaScript function is executed when elements are clicked.\ndata_id: a data id is associated with the graph element. When used within a Shiny application, elements associated with an id (data_id) can be selected and manipulated on the client and server. The list of selected values will be stored in in a reactive value named [shiny_id]_selected.\n\n\n3.3.1.1 The tooltip aesthetic\nFirst, an ggplot object will be created. Next, girafe() of ggiraph will be used to create an interactive Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a SVG?\n\n\n\nSVG is an XML-based format that is commonly used for web graphics and interactive visualizations because it allows graphics to be resized without losing quality.\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\np <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = ID),\n    stackgroups = TRUE, \n    binwidth = 1, \n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL, \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6*0.618\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n👆🏽Interactivity: By hovering the mouse pointer on an data point of interest, the student’s ID will be displayed.\nTable 1: Comparing ggplot2 and ggiraph codes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal ggplot code\nggirpah code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that two steps are involved for the ggirpah code chunk. First, an interactive version of ggplot2 geom (i.e. geom_dotplot_interactive()) is used to create the basic graph. Then, girafe() is used to generate an SVG object to be displayed on a html page.\nDisplay more information on tooltip\nHere, we included the student’s class in the tooltip.\nThe first three lines of codes below create a new field called tooltip. Text data in the ID and CLASS fields are assigned to the newly created field.

It sets a variety of options for brushing (i.e., highlighting) multiple plots. These options are primarily designed for linking multiple plotly graphs, and may not behave as expected when linking plotly to another htmlwidget package via crosstalk. In some cases, other htmlwidgets will respect these options, such as persistent selection in leaflet.\nbscols() is a helper function of crosstalk package. It makes it easy to put HTML elements side by side. It can be called directly from the console but is especially designed to work in an R Markdown document.

The following data manipulation function will come in handy:\n\nmutate() of dplyr package is used to convert all values in the 202 field into numeric data type.\nselect() of dplyr package is used to extract column 1 to 3 and Values field.\npivot_wider() of tidyr package is used to split the values in Series Name field into columns.\nleft_join() of dplyr package is used to perform a left-join by using Country Code of GDP_selected and ISO-alpha3 Code of WorldCountry tibble data tables as unique identifier.\n\n\n\nShow the code\nGDP_selected <- GDP %>%\n  mutate(Values = as.numeric(`2020`)) %>%\n  select(1:3, Values) %>%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = `Series Name`,\n              values_from = `Values`) %>%\n  left_join(y=WorldCountry, by = c(\"Country Code\" = \"ISO-alpha3 Code\"))\n\n\n\n\n3.5.2 Working with packed bar package\n\npacked bar is a relatively new data visualisation method introduced by Xan Gregg from JMP.\nIt supports the need of visualising skewed data over hundreds of categories.\nThe idea is to support the Focus+Context data visualization principle.\nVisit this JMP Blog to learn more about the design principles of packed bar.\n\nData preparation for packed bar\n\n\nShow the code\nGDP_selected <- GDP %>%\n  mutate(GDP = as.numeric(`2020`)) %>%\n  filter(`Series Name` == \"GDP (current US$)\") %>%\n  select(1:2, GDP) %>%\n  na.omit()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurpose of na.omit() in the code\n\n\n\n\nna.omit() is used to exclude rows with missing values. This is because rPackedBar package does not support missing values.\n\n\n\nWe use plotly_packed_bar() of rPackedBar package to create an interactive packed bar.\n\n\nShow the code\np = plotly_packed_bar(\n  input_data = GDP_selected,\n  label_column = \"Country Name\",\n  value_column = \"GDP\",\n  number_rows = 10,\n  plot_title = \"Top 10 countries by GDP, 2020\",\n  xaxis_label = \"GDP (US$)\",\n  hover_label = \"GDP\",\n  min_label_width = 0.018,\n  color_bar_color = \"#00aced\",\n  label_color = \"white\")\nplotly::config(p, displayModeBar = FALSE)\n\n\n\nRead this Vignettes and the user guide to learn more about the package."

For the 2nd and 3rd comment, we first summarise the data-set using group_by() and summarise() function to get the count of pupils by race. Thereafter, we use the reorder() function to sort the columns and geom_text() function to display the count.\n\nBeforeAfter\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data=exam_data, aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  ylim(0,220) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\n# Group the data by Race and aggregate by pupil count\nsorted_data <- exam_data %>% group_by(RACE) %>% summarise(count=n()) \n\n# Plot the chart\nggplot(data = sorted_data, aes(x=reorder(RACE, -count),y=count)) +\n  ylim(0,220) +\n  geom_col() +\n  ylab('No. of\\nPupils') +\n  theme(axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 0, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))+\n  xlab('Race') +\n  geom_text(aes(label = count), vjust = -0.5, size = 3.5) +\n  labs(title = \"Chinese Pupils Formed The Bulk Of The Cohort\",\n       subtitle = \"This was followed by Malay and Indian pupils\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.3 Add mean and median lines on the histogram\nWe can use the geom_vline() function to add a computed mean and median line onto the chart.\n\nBeforeAfter\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 20)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 color=\"black\", \n                 fill=\"light blue\") +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(MATHS, na.rm=T)),\n             color=\"red\", \n             linetype=\"dashed\", \n             size=1) +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=median(MATHS, na.rm=T)),\n             color=\"grey30\",\n             linetype=\"dashed\", \n             size=1) +\n            xlab('Maths Score') +\n            ylab('Count') +\n  annotate(\"label\", color = \"red\", x=mean(exam_data$MATHS, na.rm=T)+2, y=50,\n          label=paste(\"Mean: \", round(mean(exam_data$MATHS, na.rm=T), 1)),fill = \"white\") +\n  annotate(\"label\",color=\"grey30\", x=median(exam_data$MATHS, na.rm=T)+2, y=40,\n          label=paste(\"Median: \", round(median(exam_data$MATHS, na.rm=T), 1)),fill = \"white\") + \n  labs(title = \"The Median score for Maths exam was 74\",\n         subtitle = \"We have a small porpotion of pupils who scored less than 25 marks\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.4 Make the basic histogram more informative\nThe histograms below are elegantly designed but not informative. This is because they only reveal the distribution of English scores by gender but without context such as the score distribution for all pupils.\nTo show the distribution of English scores for all pupils as the background, we can add another geom_histogram() layer for all pupils.\n\nBeforeAfter\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data=exam_data, aes(x = ENGLISH )) +\n  geom_histogram() +\n  facet_wrap(~ GENDER) +\n  guides(fill = FALSE) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nd <- exam_data\n\n#create a d_bg dataframe without the gender attribute\nd_bg <- d[, -3]  \n\nggplot(d, aes(x = ENGLISH, fill = GENDER)) +\n  geom_histogram(data = d_bg, fill = \"grey\", alpha = .5) +\n  geom_histogram(colour = \"black\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ GENDER) +\n  # guides = false removes the legend from the chart\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Female\" = \"pink\", \"Male\" = \"light blue\")) +\n  guides(fill = FALSE) +  \n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(title = \"Female pupils scored higher marks than male pupils for English\",\n         subtitle = \"Their score distn covered the overall score distn for all pupuls on the right side fo the chart\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.5 Dividing a chart into 4 quadrants\nWe can use geom_hline() and geom_vline() to divide the chart into equal quadrants (see After(1)). At the same time, we can use the coord_cartesian() function to adjust the limits of the coordinate system for a plot to only display the data that falls within those limits.\nIn After (2), I included a regression line and swtich the background to white (using theme_minimal()) to make the relationship between English and Math scores more prominent.\n\nBeforeAfter (1)After (2)\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(20,99))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100)) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=50,\n             linetype=\"dashed\",\n             color=\"grey60\",\n             size=1) + \n  geom_vline(xintercept=50, \n             linetype=\"dashed\",\n             color=\"grey60\",\n             size=1) +\n  labs(title = \"Pupils who did well in English tend to excel in Math as well\",\n         subtitle = \"There is a positive correlation between English and Math scores\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100)) +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm,linewidth=1.0)  +\n  labs(title = \"Pupils who did well in English tend to excel in Math as well\",\n         subtitle = \"There is a positive correlation between English and Math scores\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(**That's\\) \\(all\\) \\(folks!**\\)"
