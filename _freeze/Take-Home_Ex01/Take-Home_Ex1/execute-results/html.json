Overview\n\n1.1 Setting the Scene\n\nCity of Engagement, with a total population of 50,000, is a small city located at Country of Nowhere. The city serves as a service centre of an agriculture region surrounding the city. The main agriculture of the region is fruit farms and vineyards.\n\nThe city council is in the process of preparing the Local Plan 2023. A sample survey of representative residents had been conducted to collect data related to their household demographic and spending patterns, among other things. The city aims to use the data to assist with their major community revitalization efforts, including how to allocate a very large city renewal grant they have recently received.\n\n1.2 Our Task\n\nWe are required to create a user-friendly and interactive solution to help city managers and planners to explore the complex data in an engaging way and reveal hidden patterns.\n\nTo this end, we will apply the concepts and methods learned from Lesson 1-4 of the course to reveal the **demographic** and **financial characteristics** of the city, using appropriate static and interactive statistical graphics methods.\n\n2.  Set Up\n\n2.1 Load the relevant packages into the R environment\n\nWe use the `pacman::p_load()` function to load the required R packages into our working environment. The loaded packages are:\n\n-   **plotly**: For creating interactive web-based graphs.\n\n-   **ggstatsplot**: For creating graphics with details from statistical tests.\n\n-   **knitr**: For dynamic report generation\n\n-   **kableExtra**: For additional functionality to format `kable()` tables created using **Knitr**\n\n-   **pacthwork**: For combining plots\\*\\*\n\n-   **ggdist**: For visualising distribution and uncertainty\n\n-   **ggthemes**: Provides additional themes for **ggplot2**\n\n-   **gridExtra**: For combining multiple plots into a single plot\n\n-   **tidyverse**: A collection of core packages designed for data science, used extensively for data preparation and wrangling.\n\n-   **DT**: For creating interactive tables using the DataTables JavaScript library\n\n-   **reshape2**: For transforming dataframes from one shape to another\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Load packages\npacman::p_load(plotly, ggstatsplot, knitr, kableExtra, patchwork, ggdist, gridExtra,ggthemes, tidyverse, DT, reshape2)\n```\n:::\n\n\n2.2 Import the data-sets\n\nTwo data-sets are provided for this exercise:\n\n\\(i\\) Partcipants.csv: contains information about the 1011 city residents who responded to the survey. Other than an identifier variable, we also have the household size, a boolean indicator for households having children, age, education level, interest group and joviality (or happiness) level of the respondents.\n\nWe import the records in the Participants.csv file as *survey*, convert the `participantId`, `householdSize` and `age` from numeric to integer data type, and convert `educationLevel` from character data type to an ordinal factor.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Import Participant.csv and assign it to survey variable\nsurvey <- read_csv('data/Participants.csv', show_col_types = FALSE ) %>%\n  mutate(participantId = as.integer(participantId),\n         householdSize = as.integer(householdSize),\n         age = as.integer(age),\n         educationLevel = as.factor(educationLevel)\n         ) %>%\n  mutate(educationLevel = ordered(educationLevel, levels = c(\"Low\",\"HighSchoolOrCollege\", \"Bachelors\",\"Graduate\")))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\\(ii\\) FinancialJournal.csv contains the financial transactions of the respondents from 1 Mar 2022 to 28 Feb 2023. Other than an identifier variable (which permits us to cross-reference to the participants' demographic information), the time, nature and amount invol/ved for the transactions were also provided.\n\nSimilarly, we import the records in the FinancialJournal.csv file as *financials*, and convert the `participantID` from numeric to integer data type and round the `amount` values to 2 decimal point.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Import FinancialJournal.csv and assign it to financials variable\nfinancials <- read_csv('data/FinancialJournal.csv', show_col_types = FALSE) %>%\n  mutate(participantId = as.integer(participantId),\n         amount = round(amount,2)\n         )\n```\n:::\n\n\n3.  Data Wrangling\n\n3.1 Create a month_year column for temporal analysis\n\nThere are 1.5 million financial transactions over the 12-month period and the daily information is too granular for us to analyse. We will create a `month_year` column, from the `timestamp` column, which will then allow us to aggregate the transactions by month for temporal analysis.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Insert a month_year column\nfinancials <- financials %>%\n  mutate(month_year = format(timestamp, \"%b-%Y\")) %>%\n  mutate(month_year = as.factor(month_year)) %>%\n  mutate(month_year = ordered(month_year, levels = c(\"Mar-2022\", \"Apr-2022\",\"May-2022\",\"Jun-2022\",\"Jul-2022\",\"Aug-2022\",\"Sep-2022\",\"Oct-2022\",\"Nov-2022\", \"Dec-2022\",\"Jan-2023\",\"Feb-2023\")))\n```\n:::\n\n\n3.2 Recode Rental Adjustments as part of Shelter Expense\n\nRent Adjustments do not occur frequently (only 131 transactions out of the 1.5 million financial transactions relate to `RentAdjustment` ) and they are essentially price adjustments associated with the cost of accommodation or rental refunds to the respondents.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Group and sumarise the transactions by category\nfinancials_grouped <- financials %>%\n  group_by(category) %>%\n  summarise(Count = n(), Sum_of_Amt = round(sum(amount),2)) \n\n# Display the results in tabular format and highliht RentalAdjustment transactions\ndatatable(financials_grouped, options = list(dom='t'), \n              caption = \"Table 1: Breakdown of Financial Journal Transactions By Categories\",\n              rownames = FALSE) %>% \n    formatStyle(1,\n                target = 'row',\n                backgroundColor = styleEqual(c('RentAdjustment'), c('lightblue')))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"datatables html-widget html-fill-item-overflow-hidden html-fill-item\" id=\"htmlwidget-2c1e55a4cc1896b15a7f\" style=\"width:100%;height:auto;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-2c1e55a4cc1896b15a7f\">{\"x\":{\"filter\":\"none\",\"vertical\":false,\"caption\":\"<caption>Table 1: Breakdown of Financial Journal Transactions By Categories<\\/caption>\",\"data\":[[\"Education\",\"Food\",\"Recreation\",\"RentAdjustment\",\"Shelter\",\"Wage\"],[3319,790051,296013,131,11463,412659],[-154367.97,-3703224.13,-4143268.97,54932.79,-7307071.92,45597686.03]],\"container\":\"<table class=\\\"display\\\">\\n  <thead>\\n    <tr>\\n      <th>category<\\/th>\\n      <th>Count<\\/th>\\n      <th>Sum_of_Amt<\\/th>\\n    <\\/tr>\\n  <\\/thead>\\n<\\/table>\",\"options\":{\"dom\":\"t\",\"columnDefs\":[{\"className\":\"dt-right\",\"targets\":[1,2]}],\"order\":[],\"autoWidth\":false,\"orderClasses\":false,\"rowCallback\":\"function(row, data, displayNum, displayIndex, dataIndex) {\\nvar value=data[0]; $(row).css({'background-color':value == \\\"RentAdjustment\\\" ?

This means that the effect on education on total wage is large as can be seen that the median total wage of a Graduate (\\$67k) is more than twice the amount of participants who received Low education (\\$30k). This is further supported by the pairwise comparison of total wages between the education levels which shows significant difference in their wages.\n\n5.3 Whether having children result in higher expenditure\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnorm_test_expenses <- function(df, column) {\n  \n  category <- if (is.factor(df[[column]])) {\n    levels(df[[column]])\n  } else if (is.character(df[[column]])) {\n    sort(unique(df[[column]]))\n  } else {\n    sort(unique(as.character(df[[column]])))\n  }\n  \n  plots <- list()\n  \n  for (class in category) {\n    \n    subset_df <- filter(df, !!sym(column) == class)\n    \n    shapiro_res <- shapiro.test(subset_df$total_expenses)\n    \n    p_value <- format(shapiro_res$p.value, digits = 3)\n    is_normal <- ifelse(shapiro_res$p.value > 0.05, \"Yes\", \"No\")\n    \n    g <- ggplot(subset_df, aes(sample = total_expenses)) +\n      stat_qq() +\n      stat_qq_line() +\n      ggtitle(paste('QQ Plot for', class)) +\n      xlab(paste(column,':',class)) + \n      ylab(\"Total Expenses\") +\n      theme_minimal() +\n      annotate(\"label\", x = -0.5, y = Inf, hjust = 1, vjust = 1.5, \n               label = paste(\"Shapiro-Wilk Normality Test:\", \"\\n\",\n                             \"p-value = \", p_value, \"\\n\",\n                             \"Is normal distn? \", is_normal),\n               fill = \"white\"\n                              )\n    \n    plots[[class]] <- g\n  }\n  \n  grid.arrange(grobs = plots, ncol = 2)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnorm_test_expenses(merged,'haveKids')\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-Home_Ex1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe then conduct the 2-sample test\n\n\n::: {.cell fig.asp='0.618'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(123)\n\nggbetweenstats(\n  data = merged,\n  x = haveKids, \n  y = total_expenses,\n  type = \"np\",\n  pairwise_comparisons=TRUE,\n  pairwise.display = \"s\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-Home_Ex1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBreadkown of Expenses for participants who have kids\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nexpenses_by_id_category <- financials_880 %>%\n  filter(category != 'Wage') %>%\n  group_by(participantId, category) %>%\n  summarise(total_spent = sum(abs(amount))) %>%\n  inner_join(select(survey, participantId, haveKids), by = \"participantId\") \n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell fig.asp='0.618'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\np<- expenses_by_id_category %>% \n  ggplot(aes(category, total_spent,fill=haveKids)) +\n  stat_pointinterval(\n    aes(interval_color = stat(fill)),\n    position = position_dodge(),\n    point_interval = median_qi,\n    .width = 0.95,\n    show.legend = TRUE\n    ) +\n  ylab(\"Total Spent\") +\n  xlab(\"Category\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\np + scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\"#339900\", \"#FF9933\"),\n    labels = c(\"FALSE\", \"TRUE\"),\n    guide = guide_legend(title = \"haveKids\"),\n    aesthetics = \"interval_color\") +\n  \n  #Title, subtitle, and caption\n  labs(title = 'Visualising uncertainty in median estimates of resale price by town',\n  subtitle = 'Quantiles intervals (95% and 99%) of resale price per flat area by Town, 2022',\n  caption = 'Resale flat princes based on registration date from Jan-2017 onwards from data.gov.sg',\n  x = \"Planning Town\",\n  y = \"Resale Price per sqm (SGD)\") +\n  \n  theme_hc() +\n  \n  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 18),\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 14),\n        legend.position = \"top\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-Home_Ex1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-28-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBased on the interval plot above, we see that all participants (with or without kids) have similar expenditures on the food and recreation.
