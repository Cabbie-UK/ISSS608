As part of the collaboration, FishEye's analysts received import/export data for Oceanus' marine and fishing industries. However, Oceanus has informed FishEye that the data is incomplete. To facilitate their analysis, FishEye transformed the trade data into a knowledge graph. Using this knowledge graph, it hopes to understand business relationships, including finding links that will help stop IUU fishing and protect marine species that are affected by it.\n\n1.2 Our Task\n\nIn response to Question 1 of VAST Chaellenge 2023: Mini-Challenge 2, our tasks are to:\n\n1.  Use visual analytics to identify temporal patterns for individual entities and between entities in the knowledge graph FishEye created from trade records, and\n2.  Categorize the types of business relationship patterns we can identify.\n\n# **2.Set Up**\n\n## **2.1 Load the relevant packages into the R environment**\n\nWe use the `pacman::p_load()` function to load the required R packages into our working environment. The loaded packages are:\n\n-   **igraph** : provides functions for creating, analyzing, and visualizing graphs\n\n-   **ggraph**: creates visualizations of graphs using the grammar of graphics approach\n\n-   **visNetwork** : creates interactive network visualizations\n\n-   **lubridate** : for working with dates and times\n\n-   **graphlayouts** : provides layout algorithms for graph visualization\n\n-   **jsonlite** : for working with JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data\n\n-   **plotly** : for creating interactive web-based graphs\n\n-   **patchwork** : for combining multiple plots into a single layout\n\n-   **knitr:** for dynamic report generation\n\n-   **kableExtra** : provides additional customization options for tables created with the knitr package,\n\n-   **treemap** : for creating treemaps\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(igraph, tidygraph, ggraph, visNetwork, lubridate,                tidyverse, graphlayouts,jsonlite, plotly, patchwork, knitr, kableExtra, treemap)\n\n# Set the default display settings for numeric values to see large numbers in full\noptions(scipen = 999, digits = 15)\n```\n:::\n\n\n2.2 Import the data\n\nThe data is a directed knowledge graph provided is in json format containing 2 data-sets.

Can be joined with the hscodes table to get additional details.\n\n-   valueofgoods_omu \\-- Customs-declared value of the total shipment, in Oceanus Monetary Units (OMU)\n\n-   volumeteu \\-- The volume of the shipment in 'Twenty-foot equivalent units', roughly how many 20-foot standard containers would be required. (Actual number of containers may have been different as there are 20ft and 40ft standard containers and tankers that do not use containers)\n\n-   weightkg \\-- The weight of the shipment in kilograms (if known)\n\nSince these working files are huge, we will store the mc2 nodes and edges data frames in *rds* format for ease of subsequent retrieval. This code need only be executed once. Thereafter we will reload the mc2_nodes and edges data frames again\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# write_rds(mc2_nodes, \"data/mc2_nodes.rds\")\nmc2_nodes = read_rds(\"data/mc2_nodes.rds\")\n\n#write_rds(mc2_edges, \"data/mc2_edges.rds\")\n# Read arrivaldate as data format\nmc2_edges <- read_rds(\"data/mc2_edges.rds\") %>%\n  mutate(arrivaldate = as.Date(arrivaldate, format = \"%Y-%m-%d\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n2.3 Data Preparation\n\n2.3.1 Edge Data Frame\n\n**Inspect the data frame**\n\nWe get some summary statistics to understand the available data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(mc2_edges)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n    source             target           arrivaldate            hscode         \n Length:5464378     Length:5464378     Min.   :2028-01-01   Length:5464378    \n Class :character   Class :character   1st Qu.:2029-09-11   Class :character  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Median :2031-04-30   Mode  :character  \n                                       Mean   :2031-05-31                     \n                                       3rd Qu.:2033-02-25                     \n                                       Max.   :2034-12-30                     \n                                                                              \n valueofgoods_omu           volumeteu                 weightkg               \n Min.   :    1100.00000   Min.   :   0.000000000   Min.   :        0.000000  \n 1st Qu.:  148130.00000   1st Qu.:   0.000000000   1st Qu.:     3060.000000  \n Median :  504485.00000   Median :   0.000000000   Median :    10300.000000  \n Mean   : 1665142.29537   Mean   :   1.471786376   Mean   :    37265.707968  \n 3rd Qu.: 1202560.00000   3rd Qu.:   0.000000000   3rd Qu.:    19730.000000  \n Max.   :44744530.00000   Max.   :1215.000000000   Max.   :495492485.000000  \n NA's   :5464097          NA's   :520933                                     \n valueofgoodsusd            \n Min.   :           0.0000  \n 1st Qu.:       26815.0000  \n Median :       72040.0000  \n Mean   :      865446.5412  \n 3rd Qu.:      158030.0000  \n Max.   :225833730200.0000  \n NA's   :3017844            \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe following are noted:\n\n-   There are 7 years of transactions, ranging from 1-Jan-2028 to 30-Dec-2034\n\n-   Valueofgood_omu, volumeteu and valueofgoodusd contain a lot of 'NA's.

Liability Co Corp (Ltd)**\n\n**Business relationship pattern**: Trades in various seafood produce as an reseller\n\n![](images/paste-6F70BF18.png){width=\"558\"}\n\nLtd does not trade with with primary suppliers directly. Instead, it plays an intermediary role, acquiring its goods and products from other resellers before supplying them to end buyers. It's unclear if it further processed the fishery products before onselling as its role appear rather redundant in the supply-chain.\n\n**Reseller 2: 144, Spanish Anchovy CJSC Marine (Spanish)**\n\n**Business relationship pattern**: Trades in various seafood produce\n\n![](images/paste-062FA276.png){width=\"604\"}\n\nUnlike Ltd, Spanish sources its goods direct from suppliers acting much like a seasfood trading company or brokerage. Seafood trading companies act as intermediaries between fishing boats, seafood suppliers, and customers. They purchase seafood directly from fishing boats locally and may also source seafood products from overseas suppliers. In addition, seafood trading companies often cater to a wide range of customers, including wholesalers, retailers, restaurants, and other food service providers.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis analysis focuses on a subset of edge transactions that involve processed or preserved seafood products, based on their HS codes. By doing so, we can reveal the trading patterns of various trading entities and the business models they adopt. Creating meaningful network graphs is a challenging task that requires a lot of time and effort to explore and experiment with different options. However, the benefit is that we can discover patterns that are not easily visible using other types of visualisation.\n\nReferences\n\n-   Harshita Kanodia (June 2022), IUU Fishing in the Indian Ocean: A Security Threat.
