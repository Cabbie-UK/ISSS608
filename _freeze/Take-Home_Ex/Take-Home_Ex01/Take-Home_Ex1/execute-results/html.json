Overview\n\n1.1 Setting the Scene\n\nCity of Engagement, with a total population of 50,000, is a small city located at Country of Nowhere. The city serves as a service centre of an agriculture region surrounding the city. The main agriculture of the region is fruit farms and vineyards.\n\nThe city council is in the process of preparing the Local Plan 2023. A sample survey of representative residents had been conducted to collect data related to their household demographic and spending patterns, among other things. The city aims to use the data to assist with their major community revitalization efforts, including how to allocate a very large city renewal grant they have recently received.\n\n1.2 Our Task\n\nWe will apply the concepts and methods learned from Lesson 1-4 of the course to reveal the **demographic** and **financial characteristics** of the city, using appropriate static and interactive statistical graphics methods. This will also help the city managers and planners explore the relevant data in an engaging way and discover any hidden patterns.\n\n1.3 The Data\n\nTwo data-sets were provided for this exercise:\n\n\\(i\\) Partcipants.csv: contains information about the 1011 city residents who responded to the survey. Other than an identifier variable, we also have the household size, a Boolean indicator for children, age, education level, interest group and joviality (or happiness) level of the respondents.\n\n\\(ii\\) FinancialJournal.csv contains the financial transactions of the respondents from 1 Mar 2022 to 1 Mar 2023. Other than an identifier variable (which permits us to cross-reference to the participants' demographic information), the time, nature and amount involved for the transactions were also provided.\n\n2.  Setting Up\n\nWe use the `pacman::p_load()` function to load the required R packages into our working environment. These loaded packages are:\n\n-   **plotly**: Used for creating interactive web-based graphs.\n\n-   **ggstatsplot**: Used for creating graphics with details from statistical tests.\n\n-   **knitr**: Used for dynamic report generation\n\n-   **pacthwork**: Used to combine plots\n\n-   **ggdist**: Used for visualising distribution and uncertainty\n\n-   **ggthemes**: Provide additional themes for **ggplot2**\n\n-   **tidyverse**: A collection of core packages designed for data science, used extensively for data preparation and wrangling.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Load packages\npacman::p_load(plotly, ggstatsplot, knitr, patchwork, ggdist, ggthemes, tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n",
