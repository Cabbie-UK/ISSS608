The city serves as a service centre of an agriculture region surrounding the city. The main agriculture of the region is fruit farms and vineyards.\n\nThe city council is in the process of preparing the Local Plan 2023. A sample survey of representative residents had been conducted to collect data related to their household demographic and spending patterns, among other things. The city aims to use the data to assist with their major community revitalization efforts, including how to allocate a very large city renewal grant they have recently received.\n\n## 1.2 Our Task\n\nWe are required to create a user-friendly and interactive solution to help city managers and planners to explore the complex data in an engaging way and reveal hidden patterns.\n\nTo this end, we will apply the concepts and methods learned from Lesson 1-4 of the course to reveal the **demographic** and **financial characteristics** of the city, using appropriate static and interactive statistical graphics methods.\n\n# 2.Set Up\n\n## 2.1 Load the relevant packages into the R environment\n\nWe use the `pacman::p_load()` function to load the required R packages into our working environment. The loaded packages are:\n\n-   **plotly**: For creating interactive web-based graphs.\n\n-   **ggstatsplot**: For creating graphics with details from statistical tests.\n\n-   **pacthwork**: For combining plots\\*\\*\n\n-   **ggdist**: For visualising distribution and uncertainty\n\n-   **ggthemes**: Provides additional themes for **ggplot2**\n\n-   **gridExtra**: For combining multiple plots into a single plot\n\n-   **tidyverse**: A collection of core packages designed for data science, used extensively for data preparation and wrangling.\n\n-   **DT**: For creating interactive tables using the DataTables JavaScript library\n\n-   **reshape2**: For transforming dataframes from one shape to another\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Load packages\npacman::p_load(plotly, ggstatsplot, patchwork, ggdist, gridExtra,ggthemes, tidyverse, DT, reshape2)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## 2.2 Import the data-sets\n\nTwo data-sets are provided for this exercise:\n\n\\(i\\) Partcipants.csv: contains information about the 1011 city residents who responded to the survey. Other than an identifier variable, we also have the household size, a boolean indicator for households having children, age, education level, interest group and joviality (or happiness) level of the respondents.\n\nWe import the records in the Participants.csv file as *survey*, convert the participantId, householdSize and age from numeric to integer data type, and convert educationLevel from character data type to an ordinal factor.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Import Participant.csv and assign it to survey variable\nsurvey <- read_csv('data/Participants.csv', show_col_types = FALSE ) %>%\n  mutate(participantId = as.integer(participantId),\n         householdSize = as.integer(householdSize),\n         age = as.integer(age),\n         educationLevel = as.factor(educationLevel)\n         ) %>%\n  mutate(educationLevel = ordered(educationLevel, levels = c(\"Low\",\"HighSchoolOrCollege\", \"Bachelors\",\"Graduate\")))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\\(ii\\) FinancialJournal.csv contains the financial transactions of the respondents from 1 Mar 2022 to 28 Feb 2023. Other than an identifier variable (which permits us to cross-reference to the participants' demographic information), the time, nature and amount involved for the transactions were also provided.\n\nWe import the records in the FinancialJournal.csv file as *financials*, and convert the participantID from numeric to integer data type and round the amount values to 2 decimal point.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Import FinancialJournal.csv and assign it to financials variable\nfinancials <- read_csv('data/FinancialJournal.csv', show_col_types = FALSE) %>%\n  mutate(participantId = as.integer(participantId),\n         amount = round(amount,2)\n         )\n```\n:::\n\n\n# 3.Data Wrangling\n\n## 3.1 Create a month_year column for temporal analysis\n\nThere are 1.5 million financial transactions over the 12-month period and the daily information is too granular for us to analyse.

the above, we observe that household size is small and the distribution of family sizes is also fairly proportionate, with about one-third of households having 1, 2 or 3 members each. As we mouse over the each column, we notice the following:\n\n-   Only households with the size of 3 have kids\n\n-   Joviality appears to be declining as the household size increases from 1 to 3\n\n-   Similar to the split by education level, average age of participants across different household sizes ranges from 38 to 40 years old.

the median and mean joviality index of the 131 participants who went \"missing\" after Mar 2022 is much higher. It's definitely worth taking a deeper look into why this group of participants was happier.\n\n# 5.Validating the Joviality and Financial Health of the Participants\n\nGiven that we are dealing with survey results, we will next conduct Confirmatory Data Analysis (CDA) to test and confirm some of the noteworthy observations from the previous section.\n\n## 5.1 Whether a higher education qualification results in more wages\n\nBefore we start validating our hypotheses, we will develop a function that will help us visualise if the data is normally distributed using a Quantile-Quantile (QQ) Plot. At the same time, we also want to conduct a Shapiro-Wilk Test for Normality to confirm that the data points really follow a normal distribution. The function will make the repetitive task of generating a normality test result for each data set easier.\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Design Considerations for the Normality Test function\n\n-   Accept inputs for a dataframe, categorical variable and a continuous measure that we will be applying the normality test on.\n\n-   Accept inputs for the plot title and y-axis label.\n\n-   Convert non-categorical variable into one that is categorical and also obtain the unique values of the variable\n\n-   Draw a QQ plot based on the inputs\n\n-   Compute the p-value for the Shapiro-Wilk Test and indicate if the data set is normally distributed based on the significance level of 0.05.\n\n-   Annotate the Shapiro-Wilk Test result on the top-left of the QQ Plot .

We will dive deeper to understand which of these expense types resulted in the significant difference in the expenditure of the 2 groups.\n\nTo do this, we have to first extract the individual expenses items of the 880 participants for the year before charting an interval plot by expense type.\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Design Considerations for Interval Plot\n\n-   For each expense item, we want to compare the spent by households with and without kids. To place each pair of interval lines together, we have to set the fill argument of the **aes()** function to the *haveKids* attribute, and set the position argument in the stat\\_**pointinterval()** function to **'position_dodge()**'.\n\n-   Set point_interval argument as median quartile since data is not normally distributed\n\n-   Align the color scheme with the previous plot by setting the values argument within the **scale_fill_manual()** function for consistency.\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Extract the individual expenses items of the 880 participants for the year\n\nexpenses_by_id_category <- financials_880 %>%\n  filter(category != 'Wage') %>%\n  group_by(participantId, category) %>%\n  summarise(total_spent = sum(abs(amount))) %>%\n  inner_join(select(survey, participantId, haveKids), by = \"participantId\") \n\n# Prepare the interval plot\n\np<- expenses_by_id_category %>% \n  ggplot(aes(category, total_spent,fill=haveKids)) +\n  stat_pointinterval(\n    aes(interval_color = stat(fill)),\n    position = position_dodge(),\n    point_interval = median_qi,\n    .width = 0.95,\n    show.legend = TRUE\n    ) +\n  ylab(\"Total Spent ($)\") +\n  xlab(\"Expense Category\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  # Align the color scheme with the previou plot\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\"#FADFC1\", \"#E3A6AB\"),\n    labels = c(\"FALSE\", \"TRUE\"),\n    guide = guide_legend(title = \"haveKids\"),\n    aesthetics = \"interval_color\") +\n  #Title, subtitle, and caption\n  labs(title = 'Visualising Uncertainty in Median Spend of Participants by Expense Type',\n  subtitle = '95% Quantiles intervals of median spend between participants With and WithOut kids') +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 14),\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n        legend.position = \"top\") \n\np\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-Home_Ex1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-31-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBased on the interval plot above, we see that all participants (with and without kids) have overlapping interval lines for food, recreation and shelter, indicating there is uncertainty on whether this is a significant difference in the median spend at 95% quantile for the 2 groups of participants on the 3 expense types.\n\nIt is also apparent that the spending on education , probably for the kids, is an expense item that participants without kids do not have to incur.\n\n## 5.4 Whether bigger households face a higher burden in cost of living\n\nWe will use the total expense to total wage ratio as a proxy measure for the cost of living in the city.\n\n**Step1:** For the Shapiro-Wilk Test, we hypothesize,\n\n-   H0 = The expense-to-wage ratio for different household sizes is normally distributed at 0.05 level of significance\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnormality_test(merged, 'householdSize','expense_to_wage',\"Normality Test on Expense To Wage Ratio for Household Size\",\"Expense-to-Wage Ratio\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-Home_Ex1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-32-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSince we cannot assume Normality for the data based on the results of Step 1, we will apply non-parametric test to test the significance of the difference.\n\n**Step 2:** For the nonparametric Kruskal-Willis Test, we hypothesize,\n\n-   H0 = There is no difference between the expense-to-wage ratio of the participants with different household size at 0.05 level of significance.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(123)\n\n# Set a color scheme for Household Size Level analysis for consistency\ncolors2 <- c('#CC9881', '#FADFC1', '#E3A6AB', '#A87B9F')\n\nggbetweenstats(\n  data = merged,\n  x = householdSize, \n  y = expense_to_wage,\n  type = \"np\",\n  pairwise_comparisons=TRUE,\n  pairwise.display = \"s\",\n  bf.message = FALSE,\n  notch = TRUE,\n  notchwidth = 0.1,\n  ylab = \"Expense-to-Wage Ratio\",\n  title = \"One-Way ANOVA on Expense-to-Wage Ratio\",\n  messages = FALSE\n)  +\n  scale_color_manual(values = colors2) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-Home_Ex1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-33-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe p-value is \\> 0.05 indicating that there is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the cost-to-wage ratio for larger households are different. Hence, we can also infer that even though we noticed families with kids incur higher expenses in Section 5.3, generally, the residents of these bigger households will earn more to defray the higher cost of living.\n\n# 6.Conclusion\n\nThrough this exercise, we demonstrated how interactive and statistical plots can help us understand and analyse the survey data.\n\nWe explored the data in Section 4 using various visualisations to understand the distribution, relationships, and patterns in the data. We found that higher education level and bigger household size are associated with higher income and expenditure, the city has a low population growth rate, and the residents have a moderate level of happiness. We also performed statistical tests to confirm some of these findings and hypotheses. The analysis presented here is not exhaustive, but it should give city managers and planners a good overview of the demographic and financial situation of the city.\n\n# 7.Reference\n\n-   How to conduct and visualise Kruskal-Wallis Test\n\n    [(6) R demo \\| Kruskal-Wallis test + Post-Hoc \\| How to conduct, visualize, interpret & more 😉 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-hS2zoRPOY)\n\n-   How to conduct 2-sample t-test\n\n    [Two-Sample t-Test \\| Introduction to Statistics \\| JMP](https://www.jmp.com/en_sg/statistics-knowledge-portal/t-test/two-sample-t-test.html)\n\n-   How to perform Normality Test Assumption for ANOVA\n\n    [One Way ANOVA (gribblelab.org)](https://gribblelab.org/teaching/stats2019/notes/One_Way_ANOVA.pdf)\n\n-   Michael Djohan's VAA course webpage\n\n    [Visual Analytics - Michael Djohan - Visual Analytics & Application Learning Journey (isss608-michaeldj.netlify.app)](https://isss608-michaeldj.netlify.app/)\n",
